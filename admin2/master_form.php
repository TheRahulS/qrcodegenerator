                                                The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate
                                                existence is a myth.
                                                For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The
                                                languages only differ
                                                in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.
                                                Everyone
                                                realizes why a
                                                new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay
                                                expensive
                                                translators. To
                                                achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar,
                                                pronunciation
                                                and more common
                                                words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting
                                                language
                                                is more simple
                                                and regular than that of the individual languages.
